        audio similarity loss. More sensitive to peak magnitudes than log
        magnitudes.
      delta_time_weight: Weight to compare the first finite difference of
        spectrograms in time. Emphasizes changes of magnitude in time, such as
        at transients.
      delta_freq_weight: Weight to compare the first finite difference of
        spectrograms in frequency. Emphasizes changes of magnitude in frequency,
        such as at the boundaries of a stack of harmonics.
      cumsum_freq_weight: Weight to compare the cumulative sum of spectrograms
        across frequency for each slice in time. Similar to a 1-D Wasserstein
        loss, this hopefully provides a non-vanishing gradient to push two
        non-overlapping sinusoids towards eachother.
      logmag_weight: Weight to compare log magnitudes of spectrograms. Core
        audio similarity loss. More sensitive to quiet magnitudes than linear
        magnitudes.
      loudness_weight: Weight to compare the overall perceptual loudness of two
        signals. Very high-level loss signal that is a subset of mag and
        logmag losses.
